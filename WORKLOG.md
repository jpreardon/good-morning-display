## Summary

For this version 2 of the Good Morning display, I'm currently targeting a Raspberry Pi touch display. It's overkill for simple stuff, but one day, I might want to get more advanced. It would be great if this thing turned itself on and off either based on time of day, or if anyone is standing in front of it, or both.

## TODO

- Hook up [NWS API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) ([json spec](https://api.weather.gov/openapi.json))
  - My grid square and zone are 34,33 and NYZ075
  - [Current conditions](https://api.weather.gov/stations/KNYC/observations/latest)
  - [Forecast](https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/OKX/34,33/forecast) and [hourly forecast](https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/OKX/34,33/forecast/hourly) are available. I'm leaning toward the more text based forecast over the hourly. However, I have seen some errors where the forecast doesn't exist:
  ```
  status: 503
  title: Forecast Grid Invalid
  detail: The forecast grid is missing data for time 2020-04-18T18:00:00-04:00.
  ```
  - [Alerts](https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active/zone/NYZ075)
- Get mockup running on raspi? (see 2020-04-12 notes), if not, what to do? Might need to make a more responsive interface.
- Mock up cool wind/relative humidity features in HTML

## Notes

### 2020-04-12

Work on getting a basic page mocked up. We're targeting the 800x480 display on a Raspberry Pi touch for this project.

- Made a super simple HTML 5 index.html based on [HTML 5 boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/index.html). I skipped much of what is there, I'll probably need to add it at some point. I'm putting all the styles in that file, for now. I'll break it out soon enough.
- I originally mocked this thing up with Helvetica, but I'm not paying for that web font, so I'm going with Roboto, it's close enough for this exercise.
- I'm using a grid layout, I hope the browser on the raspi can handle it
- Basic HTML mockup done
  - It doesn't include some of the cool wind/relative humidity features
  - I made some changes to the font sizes and weights to make things fit better in the viewport
- Setting up [Raspi in kiosk mode](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-kiosk/), need a better browser.
  - This was a good setup guide, but it failed to tell me to install chromium (it probably expects a more recent raspi), so I installed it. It looks like Chromium doesn't support css grid :(
  - Installed Firefox. CSS grid works, but the page looks like crap on the raspitouch screen, and I've found that the touch screen no longer works :(
  - Given the low res and lack of touch interface, I might rethink my display strategy. I'm going to work on the data side of things for bit, then come back to this.

### 2020-04-11

- Create new branch
- Delete everything except the readme
- Update the readme
- Add the design file
- Add PDF of design ideas
- Experimented with the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) a bit. I put the details in the TODO above.

For context:

This hasn't been working for quite some time. Here's a note from a now deleted branch that was meant to fix the issue:

> 2019-03-16

> The Weather Channel, which now owns Weather Underground now, have shut down the API that was being used here. I'm going to try using the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) instead.

The transit status no longer works either. I think they changed the format and URL a few weeks ago. 

I'm going to ditch the whole thing and start fresh...

By the way, I'm not sure if it is best practice to do this sort of thing in a branch, then merge and tag a new version. I'm going with the latter just to keep it in one place.
